# Intro
What is this? It the API for Yet Another Test Case Manager. After searching and reviewing many test case management tools online I've come to the conclusion that they're either archaic flaming pieces of garbage, extremely cost prohibitive, or both ([Lean Testing](https://leantesting.com/) actually seems to be alright). Thus I've decided to start this project in hopes of doing something [better](https://xkcd.com/927/).

# How do I run it?
 You don't. Currently the API is in the design phase. However the goal of the API is to be flexible enough so that the UI can be customizable enough to fit a wide variety of needs. See the design folder for current state of things.
